      <p><b> Description: </b>Conway's Game of Life with extensive functionality.</p>

      <p> <b>Methodology:</b> We used the Agile Scrum framework. Thanks to it's flexible design and <br>
      the ease in implementation with continuous reiteration and reevealuation of priorities, the <br>
    the team was able to seamlessly coordinate between each other with clear and distinct roles. The <br>
    framework allowed us to implement sprints where we continuously gave input on project status, issues and, <br>
  most importantly, successes. Thanks to this Methodology, we were able to complete the entirety of our project<br>
within half the alloted time for project submission.</p>
